# Real-Time Collaboration Features

## Overview

Your brainstorming app now includes comprehensive real-time collaboration features that allow multiple users to work together seamlessly on the same canvas board.

## Features Implemented

### üéØ Real-Time Element Synchronization
- **Live Element Creation**: When one user creates a sticky note, shape, or text element, it instantly appears for all other users
- **Live Element Updates**: Moving, resizing, or editing elements is synchronized in real-time
- **Live Element Deletion**: Deleting elements is immediately reflected across all connected users
- **Optimistic Updates**: Local changes appear instantly while syncing in the background

### üó≥Ô∏è Real-Time Voting
- **Live Vote Updates**: When users vote on sticky notes, vote counts update instantly for all collaborators
- **Vote Removal**: Removing votes is also synchronized in real-time
- **Visual Feedback**: Vote indicators show immediately across all sessions

### üë• User Presence & Awareness
- **Live Cursors**: See other users' mouse cursors moving around the canvas in real-time
- **User Identification**: Each user's cursor is color-coded with their name displayed
- **Active User List**: View all currently active collaborators on the board
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicator showing collaboration server connection status

### üé® Visual Indicators
- **Connection Status**: Green indicator when connected, red when disconnected
- **Active Collaborators**: List showing all users currently on the board
- **Live Cursor Trails**: Smooth cursor movement with user name labels
- **Real-time Notifications**: Instant visual feedback for all collaborative actions

## How It Works

### Backend (Socket.IO Server)
- WebSocket server integrated with Fastify
- Room-based collaboration (one room per project)
- User authentication via JWT tokens
- Real-time event broadcasting to all connected users

### Frontend (React + Socket.IO Client)
- Custom `useCollaboration` hook for managing real-time features
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Cursor position tracking and broadcasting
- Real-time event handling for all canvas operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Backend server must be running
- Frontend must be connected to the backend
- Users must be authenticated and part of the same workspace

### Usage
1. **Join a Board**: Navigate to any board - you'll automatically connect to the collaboration server
2. **See Other Users**: Active collaborators appear in the top-right corner
3. **Real-time Editing**: Create, move, edit, or delete elements - changes sync instantly
4. **Vote Together**: Vote on sticky notes and see real-time vote counts
5. **Track Cursors**: Watch other users' cursors as they navigate the canvas

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components
- **`SocketService`**: Backend WebSocket service handling all real-time events
- **`useCollaboration`**: Frontend React hook managing Socket.IO connection
- **`LiveCursors`**: Component displaying other users' cursor positions
- **`CollaborationStatus`**: Component showing connection status and active users

### Events Synchronized
- `element_created` - New canvas elements
- `element_updated` - Element position, size, or content changes
- `element_deleted` - Element removal
- `vote_added` - New votes on sticky notes
- `vote_removed` - Vote removal
- `cursor_moved` - Mouse cursor position updates
- `user_joined` - New user joining the board
- `user_left` - User leaving the board

### Security
- JWT token authentication for Socket.IO connections
- Room-based isolation (users only see events from their project)
- User permission validation on all operations

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Check if the backend server is running
- Verify WebSocket connections aren't blocked by firewall
- Ensure JWT tokens are valid and not expired

### Performance
- Cursor position updates are throttled to prevent spam
- Large element updates use optimistic rendering
- Connection automatically reconnects on failure

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with WebSocket support
- Fallback to HTTP polling if WebSockets unavailable
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
